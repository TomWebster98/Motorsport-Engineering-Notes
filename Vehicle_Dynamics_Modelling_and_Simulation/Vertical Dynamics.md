## The Power of Isolation

- A system can be isolated from a noise source with effective suspension design and tuning.

- Considering the suspension as a mass-spring-damper system, the transfer function can be considered. Considering transmissibility, it is possible to determine the effectiveness of the system damping.

- Transmissibility = Output / Input
    - Here, the output is the force transmitted and the input is the force applied.
    - For $T>1$, force amplification is taking place. This is at its maximum when the forcing frequency and the natural frequency of the system coincide.
    - For $T<1$, the system is being damped.
    - For $T=1$, the system acts as a rigid body.
