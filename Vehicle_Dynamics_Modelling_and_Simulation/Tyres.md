# How do tyres work?

## Overview

Tyre behaviour is key in vehicle dynamics since they are the primary source of force and torque acting on the vehicle, with the exception of aerodynamics.

Tyre Factors:

- V = Longitudinal speed
- $\Omega$ = Rotational velocity
- $\alpha$ = Slip angle
- $F_{x}$ = Longitudinal force (x-plane)
- $F_{y}$ = Lateral force (y-plane)
- $M_{z}$ = Aligning torque (about the z-axis)

A tyre interaction with the road happens over a "contact patch" - the tyre behaviour is non-linear. Since this behaviour is non-linear, we can't use the Coulomb friction principle.

 Tyre Grip Mechanisms:

- Adhesive Friction, Mechanical purchase between irregularities acting in a similar manner to a gear mechanism.
- Hysteretic friction, Chemical bonding as a result of the tyre material (rubber).

 Pressures:

- Tyres carry the vertical load of a vehicle as a result of the inflation pressure.
- Tyre inflation pressure is essential to ensuring adequate pressure distribution across the surface of the tyre and therefore avoid excessive localised wear.
- If a tyre is under-inflated, the bulk of the load will be carried on the outer perimeter of the tyre, whereas for over-inflation the bulk load is carried along the centre line of the tyre.
- Appropriate tyre inflation presssure ensures a maximised contact patch and even pressure distirbution, which improves grip and wear.
