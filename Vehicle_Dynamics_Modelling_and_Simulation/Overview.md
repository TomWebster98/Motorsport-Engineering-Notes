# What is Vehicle Dynamics?

- The science of studying vehicle motion and its causes.
- The study of how a vehicle responds to different inputs, setup and external conditions.

## Basics

- Handling: 
    - Vehicle qualities affecting the performance and stability during longitudinal and latitudinal directional response.
    **OR**
    - Vehicle qualities affecting the ease of driving due to these same responses.

- Ride:
    - Vehicle qualitites affecting the system vibration excited by surface irregularities and its effects on both passengers and performance.
    - Primary Ride: 0.2 - 2.5 Hz
    - Secondary Ride (Shake): 3 - 8 Hz
    - Secondary Ride (Harshness): 5 - 25 Hz

### Coordinate Definitions
- Translation:
    - x, Longitudinal, positive to the front.
    - y, Lateral, positive to the left.
    - z, vertical, positive upwards.

- Rotation:
    - Roll, positive rotation to the right. (Around the x axis)
    - Pitch, positive rotation to the front. (Around the y axis)
    - Yaw, positive rotation to the left. (Around the z axis)

- Vehicle dimensions include:
    - L = Wheelbase. Distance from the centre of the back wheel to the centre of the front wheel.
    - a = Longitudinal distance from front axle to the centre of mass.
    - b = Longitudinal distance from rear axle to the centre of mass.
    - h = Centre of Mass Height.
    - t<sub>f</sub> = Front axle track. Distance between the centre of each front wheel.
    - t<sub>t</sub> = Rear axle track. Distance between the centre of each rear wheel.

## Forces

- Weight (gravitational force): $F_g = m \cdot g$

- Aerodynamic Drag: $F_{drag} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot C_{d} \cdot v^2$

- Aerodynamic Downforce: $F_{DF} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho \cdot A \cdot C_{z} \cdot v^2$

    - $\rho$ = Air Density
    - A = Frontal Area
    - $c_d$ = Coefficient of Drag
    - $c_z$ = Coefficient of Lift

- Additional tyre friction and vertical forces act on the vehicle.
